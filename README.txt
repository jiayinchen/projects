Hi TA, we worked really hard for this assignment and nearly everything works fine except a few details.
WELCOME PAGE: 100% done
LOGIN/REGISTER page: 100% done
DASHBOARD: 
	Our code works well. We have the menu to go to make a friend, see a friend and logout. 
	We also have a box that asks for the update and generate the 20 first updates in a box on the same file.
	However, we were not able to select out to only print out the posts from the user and his friends.
	We worked really hard on this problem and you can look at commented out code we wrote for that part in the status.cgi file.
MAKE A FRIEND: 100% done
SEE A FRIEND:
	The page is generated and there are options to go to dashboard, logout and see profile (using a radio form).
	However, we were not able to generate the list of friends properly for the radio form.
	The select a friend button does work and do direct to a valid page with a username.
